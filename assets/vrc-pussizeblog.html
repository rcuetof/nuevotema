<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;If you have an inverted triangle body (wider at the top and narrower at the bottom), here are some tips for choosing dresses that fit your figure:</strong></em></h3>
<div class="card-mod" style="text-align: center;"><h2>Flounce Sleeve Lace Detail Dress</h2><a href="https://www.violettarcshop.com/products/plus-size-flounce-sleeve-lace-detail-dress" class="button">Shop Now!</a><img style="margin: 10px autopx 10px autopx; float: none;" alt="Plus Size Dresses Flounce Sleeve Lace Detail Dress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/products/fcdd4920ae92408d9466c4c59fefd2cd-Max.jpg"></div>
<ul>
<li>High Waist: Dresses with a high waist or waist details can help create the illusion of a more balanced shape. This also highlights the slimmer part of your torso.</li>
<li>Round Neck: Round neck dresses help soften the shoulder line, they also draw attention to the neck and face, creating balance with the lower part of the body.</li>
<li>High neck : These dresses can also be attractive options, also by focusing attention on your neck and face</li>
<li>Empire cut: Empire cut dresses, which have the waist just below the bust, are ideal for highlighting the narrowest part of your torso and creating a more defined silhouette.</li>
<li>Flowy Fabrics: Opt for soft, flowy fabrics instead of tight-fitting fabrics. This will help the dress slide smoothly over your figure instead of being too tight.</li>
<li>Appropriate length: The length of the dress is also important. Dresses that hit just above or below the knee are generally flattering for most figures.</li>
<li>Avoid volume at the top: Try to avoid dresses with bulky details at the top, such as exaggerated shoulder pads or puffed sleeves, as they can make your upper body appear larger.</li>
<li>Strategic prints and colors: Prints and colors can divert attention. If you prefer to hide the upper part, choose darker colors or smaller prints for that area and leave lighter colors or bolder prints for the lower part.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;If you have an hourglass body shape (with well-defined curves at the top and bottom and a narrower waist), you can highlight and accentuate those curves to flatter your figure.</strong></em></h3>
<div class="card-mod" style="text-align: center;"><h2>Melo Apparel Plus Size Houndstooth V-Neck Midi Dress</h2><a href="https://www.violettarcshop.com/products/melo-apparel-plus-size-houndstooth-v-neck-midi-dress" class="button">Shop Now!</a><img style="margin: 10px autopx 10px autopx; float: none;" alt="Melo Apparel Plus Size Houndstooth V-Neck Midi Dress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/products/e3ffe492b27249b6bfafd8e7352fff45-Max.jpg"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the waist: Since you already have a defined waist, emphasize that area by wearing dresses that fit at the waist. Dresses with a princess cut, A-line or dresses fitted at the waist are ideal options, body-hugging dresses or dresses in a mermaid or container cut.</li>
<li>V-necklines or boat necks: V-necklines or boat necks are excellent for highlighting the upper part of your body. They help balance the figure and draw attention to the face.</li>
<li>Stretchy, form-fitting fabrics: Stretchy, form-fitting fabrics can enhance your natural curves without being too tight. Dresses with fabrics that gently adapt to your shapes can be very flattering.</li>
<li>Full skirts: Full skirts, such as flared or pleated skirts, can highlight your hips and thighs, accentuating the lower part of your body in an elegant way.</li>
<li>Avoid clothes that are too loose: Although comfort is important, avoid dresses that are too baggy that can hide your curves. It is best to select clothes that fit your body properly.</li>
<li>Strategic prints: Prints can be your allies. Prints that follow the line of your body can help highlight your curves in a subtle way.</li>
<li>Skinny Belts: Adding skinny belts to the waist of your dresses can be a great way to highlight your hourglass figure even more.</li>
<li>Versatile Length: The length of the dress can vary depending on your preference, but generally, dresses that hit or just above the knee are flattering for this body shape.</li>
</ul>

<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;If you have a straight body shape (shoulders and waist of the same size), you can highlight and accentuate those curves to enhance your figure.</strong></em></h3>
<div class="card-mod" style="text-align: center;"><h2>Drawstring Collared Neck Dress</h2><a href="https://www.violettarcshop.com/products/plus-size-drawstring-collared-neck-dress" class="button">Shop Now!</a><img style="margin: 10px autopx 10px autopx; float: none;" alt="Drawstring Collared Neck Dress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/products/f35aac610f1d4ab09c22846cc455b25b-Max.jpg"></div>
<ul>
<li>Highlight your curves: Opt for dresses that have details at the waist to create the illusion of curves. Dresses with belts, bows or details in the waist area can be ideal.</li>
<li>V-neckline: Dresses with a V-neckline help to visually lengthen the neck and create a feeling of more defined curves.</li>
<li>Appropriate length: Choose dresses that reach the narrowest part of your legs to highlight that area. Dresses that end just above or below the knee (“midi dresses or mini dresses”) can be a good option.</li>
<li>Fabrics and prints: Opt for fabrics that fit gently to your body without being too tight. Small prints and dark colors tend to be more flattering, but don't be afraid to experiment with patterns and colors you like.</li>
<li>Avoid baggy clothing: Although it may be tempting to wear baggy clothing to hide certain areas, this can make your figure look less defined. Look for clothes that fit flatteringly.</li>
<li>Vertical lines: Vertical lines, whether seams, pleats or prints, can help visually elongate your figure.</li>
<li>Accessories: Use accessories such as long necklaces, scarves or belts to add visual interest and draw attention to areas you want to highlight.</li>
<li>Try different styles: Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles of dresses to find out what makes you feel most confident and comfortable.</li>
</ul>

<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;If you have an apple-shaped body, (you may have your curves more accentuated in the central part of your body). Here are some tips for dressing flatteringly:</strong></em></h3>
<div class="card-mod" style="text-align: center;"><h2>Floral Surplice Neck Flutter Sleeve Dress</h2><a href="https://www.violettarcshop.com/products/plus-size-floral-surplice-neck-flutter-sleeve-dress" class="button">Shop Now!</a><img style="margin: 10px autopx 10px autopx; float: none;" alt="Floral Surplice Neck Flutter Sleeve Dress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/products/d366fcb594974f7e809bd3e0431cfe3b-Max.jpg"></div>
<ul>
<li>Empire-cut dresses: Opt for dresses with an empire cut, which fit just below the bust. This helps highlight the thinnest part of your torso and create a more defined line.</li>
<li>Flowing fabrics: Choose soft, flowing fabrics instead of tight-fitting garments. This will provide comfort and avoid highlighting the abdomen area too much.</li>
<li>V or U necklines: V or U necklines can help visually elongate the neck and draw attention away from the abdominal area.</li>
<li>Flared or flared dresses : Dresses with a flared cut or flared from the waist are ideal, as they help hide the abdomen area without losing femininity.</li>
<li>Wrap dresses: Wrap dresses can be an excellent option, as they fit at the waist and create a more defined shape.</li>
<li>Strategic prints: Opt for prints that draw the eye up or down, such as vertical stripes or smaller prints. This can help visually balance the figure.</li>
<li>Appropriate accessories: Use accessories such as long necklaces or bracelets to draw attention to other parts of your body and not just the abdominal area.</li>
<li>Structured garments: Look for dresses with structured details on the top, such as sleeves or shoulder details, to balance the figure.</li>
<li>Dark colors: Dark colors tend to visually slim you. You can consider dresses in dark tones, but it's also okay to incorporate brighter colors or prints in other parts of the dress.</li>
<li>Wide belts: If you decide to wear a belt, opt for wide belts that sit at the narrowest part of your torso.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/files/separate_100x100.png?v=1710309804" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><em><strong>&nbsp;If you have a triangle or pear-shaped body, (your hips are likely wider than your shoulders and you have a well-defined waist). Here are some tips for dressing flatteringly:</strong></em></h3>
<div class="card-mod" style="text-align: center;"><h2>Pocketed V-Neck Short Sleeve Lounge Dress</h2><a href="https://www.violettarcshop.com/products/plus-size-pocketed-v-neck-short-sleeve-lounge-dress" class="button">Shop Now!</a><img style="margin: 10px autopx 10px autopx; float: none;" alt="Pocketed V-Neck Short Sleeve Lounge Dress" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4789/8056/products/b0f70763-5968-41f1-a2f0-dd6f2f55e9d6-Max.jpg"></div>
<ul>
<li>Highlight the upper part: Wear dresses that highlight the upper part of your body to balance your figure. Low necklines, shoulder details, statement sleeves or bright colors on the top can be ideal options.</li>
<li>A-line dresses: A-line dresses are perfect for the triangle shape, as they are tighter at the top and open gently at the bottom, hiding the hips.</li>
<li>Waist Belts: Use waist belts to highlight this area and create a smooth transition between your upper and lower body.</li>
<li>Soft fabrics: Opt for soft, flowing fabrics to provide comfort and avoid highlighting your hips too much.</li>
<li>Prints and colors on the top: You can play with prints, bright colors or details on the top to draw attention to that area and away from the hips.</li>
<li>A-line or flared skirts: A-line or flared skirts are ideal for creating balance, as they add volume at the bottom, hiding the hips.</li>
<li>Princess line dresses: Princess line dresses are fitted at the top and gradually open down, favoring the triangle shape.</li>
<li>Avoid tight cuts at the bottom: Avoid dresses that are very tight at the bottom, as they can highlight the hips too much. Opt for looser and more fluid cuts.</li>
<li>Dresses with top details: Look for dresses with interesting details on the top, such as statement necklines, sleeves, ruffles or textures, to draw the eye upward.</li>
<li>Statement accessories: Use statement accessories on top, such as statement necklaces or earrings, to draw attention away from the bottom.</li>
