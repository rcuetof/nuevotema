<h3 data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Curvy fashion?</strong></h3>
<p>It generally refers to fashion for large or curvy sizes. It focuses on designing and offering clothing that fits and highlights the beauty of people with curves and larger sizes. This approach seeks to promote inclusion and diversity in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>Although there have always been XXL sizes, the perception of fashion in relation to these sizes has evolved, to the point of becoming very common standards in many brands.</p>

<p>Throughout history, plus size models have been key to the development of a real image of women in our society. There has always been controversy over the diversification of sizes, which led to a simplified classification of female bodies as "pear" or "apple" prototypes. However, today, plus sizes not only exist, but have also become a prominent presence in an industry that is finally recognizing the importance of plus sizes and their prevalence.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1">Although brands have announced in the past their intention to regulate sizing to cover all body types, unfortunately, this commitment has not been fully realized.</p>
<p>Curvy fashion has challenged preconceived notions of beauty by celebrating diversity of sizes and shapes. This revolution has inspired designers to create garments that enhance and embrace curves, promoting a positive and healthy body image.<br>According to a study carried out in the US, it is estimated that 37% of North American women wear sizes XXL.</p>
<h3>Trends:</h3>
<p>curvy fashion has introduced a variety of trends that have made women see their bodies in a healthier way and improved the relationship they have with their body and mind. Tailored suits, asymmetrical cuts and vibrant prints are just a few of the options that allow curvy women to express their style with confidence. In addition, the designers have incorporated strategic details, to be able to bring out all the natural beauty of curvy women in an elegant way.</p>
